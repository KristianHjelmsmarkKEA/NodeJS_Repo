        VScode -Visual Studio Code is the chosen, and used IDE for this semester, reason being, to <br>
        get experience using different IDE’s than previous semesters, and get more used and familiar <br>
        to terminal commands.<br>
        Through Visual Studio Code, you can program in many different languages, like Python, <br>
        C#, c++ and so on.<br><br>

    <h1>Terminal Commands</h1>
    <p>
        In our IDE - Visual Studio Code, we have access to a inbuilt terminal, where you <br>
        can chose different types: Powershell, node, GitBash... <br><br>
        Through various commands, we can ofcourse change directories via "cd /folder/folder",<br>
        and run our applications in different modes, just like a normal CMD. <br> <br>
        
        "npm install", "npm i" or the direcet version "npm express" -Installs the <br> 
        dependencies in package.json, or directly via the commandline, and adds <br>
        the dependency to your package.json file. <br>
        So far in our semester, we've mostly used Express, which is a dependency to <br>
        help quickly and efficiently setup servers, in a minimalist and flexible way. <br> <br>

        Various commands we've used so far: <br>
        Node app.js -Runs the application. <br><br>
        Nodemon.cmd app.js -runs the application in "developermode", and continuelsy <br>
        searches for changes in files, if a change is made, you donâ€™t have to restart <br>
        the server, but just refresh the browser page, and the change will be registered. <br>
        rs -restarts server <br><br>
        Npm init - New project setup, this takes you through a series of information, versioning <br>
        and likewise input regarding the new project. The set information, afterwards be <br>
        seen in your package.json file, along with dependencies installed.

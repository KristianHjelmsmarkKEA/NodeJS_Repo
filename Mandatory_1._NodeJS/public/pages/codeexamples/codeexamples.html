    <p>
        In your app.js file, you should have start with having: <br>
        
        <xmp>
            const express = require("express");      //Imports the express framework.
            const app = express();                   //This will instantiates express
        </xmp>
        
        In the bottom of your apps.js file, you should have: 
        <xmp>
        const PORT = process.env.PORT || 9000;  

        const server = app.listen(PORT, () => {             
            console.log("The server is running on port: ", server.address().port);
        });
        </xmp>

        In package.json, you can make commandline scripts, same syntax as with dependencies: <br>
        <xmp>
            "scripts": {
                "start-dev": "cross-env PORT=3000 nodemon app.js",
                "start": "node app.js"
            },
        </xmp>
        This can be used in many ways, in this case, to setup a developermode command called “start-dev”<br>
        using nodemon, for real time changes to files, and a specified port, if not called, the app<br>
        will run on the default port, specified in app.js.<br><br>
        
        "process.env.PORT || 9000" - Fucntions as a fallback port, so if the port is not <br>
        specifed when the applications starts, it will default to port 9000. <br> <br>
        
        App.listen returns an object, which is a server, and the let’s you know in your cmd,<br>
        whether or not the server is running by the console.log line, aswell as which port <br>
        is being used, this is helpful during development.<br>
         
    </p>
